<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my website. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer in the Greater NYC Area, a second time Software Engineering Intern at <a style=" color: black; " href="http://elementalpath.com/" target="_BLANK">Elemental Path</a> and a former Software Engineering Intern at <a style=" color: black; " href="https://www.apple.com" target="_BLANK">Apple</a>. I'm most interested in Backend Web Engineering but have experience with Frontend Web Engineering and iOS Development as well. I'm a big fan of web services, microservices architecture, data modeling, web scraping, data analytics and more!

I've also been to 20 hackathons as either a hacker or a mentor - check out some of my hackathon projects <a href="https://devpost.com/jayrav13" target="_BLANK">here</a>.
