<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my website.

I'm most interested in Backend Web Engineering but have experience with Frontend Web Engineering and iOS Development as well. I'm a big fan of web services, microservices architecture, data modeling, web scraping, data analytics, hackathons and more!</p>
