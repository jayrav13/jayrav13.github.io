<p>Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my website. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer, currently working on my Master's Degree in Computer Science. While pursuing my degree, I've had the opportunity to be a Software Engineering Intern at both <a href="http://elementalpath.com/" target="_BLANK">Elemental Path</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_BLANK">Apple</a>.</p>
<p>I'm specifically a Backend Web Engineer with experience in PHP, Python and Ruby and have experience with Frontend Engineering and iOS Development as well. And I'm a big fan of hackathons.</p>
<p>I'm currently looking for full-time roles starting January 2017 or May 2017 in NYC and the Bay Area; feel free to check out my resume <a href="/assets/JayRavaliya_Resume.pdf" target="_BLANK">here!</a></p>
